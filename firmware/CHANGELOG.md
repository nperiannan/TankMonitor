# Changelog

All notable changes to the Tank Monitor ESP32-S3 firmware are documented here.

---

## [1.3.2] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- **LCD backlight mode selector** — Web UI setting to choose `Auto`, `Always On`, or `Always Off`. Persisted in NVS, applied immediately.
- **MQTT password change from web UI** — Settings card with password input and confirm dialog. Sends `set_mqtt_creds` command over MQTT to update NVS credentials on the ESP32 — no reflash needed.

### Removed
- **BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) toggle removed from web UI** — BLE was already removed from firmware in v1.1.0; the toggle in the settings page has now been removed to match.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **ESP32-S3 crash/reboot loop** — BLE library registered with the WiFi coexistence module even without calling `BLEManager::begin()`, causing an abort when `WiFi.mode(WIFI_AP_STA)` was set with `PS_NONE`. Fixed by excluding `BLEManager.cpp` from the build via `build_src_filter`.
- **MQTT callback stack overflow** — `onMessage()` was directly invoking NTP sync, BLE send and `ESP.restart()` from within the PubSubClient callback (small stack). Fixed by queuing the raw payload and processing it from the main loop via `processPendingMQTT()`.
- **Adding a new WiFi SSID disconnected the active connection** — `handleAddNetwork()` called `WiFi.disconnect()` unconditionally. Fixed to skip disconnect if the device is already connected.
- **MQTT broker hardcoded to LAN IP** — Broker was hardcoded to `192.168.0.102` and overwritten in NVS on every boot. Fixed by using `nperiannan-nas.freemyip.com` as default and adding NVS migration (`seedDefaultsIfEmpty`) that rewrites the old IP only once.
- **AP mode unstable during STA reconnect** — `WiFi.scanNetworks(false)` (blocking scan, ~3 s) was disrupting AP beaconing, causing clients to drop. Changed to `WiFi.scanNetworks(true)` (async) with polling via `WiFi.scanComplete()` so the AP stays fully alive during scanning.

### Added
- **WiFi state machine** — Priority-ordered STA reconnection with 3 attempts per SSID (10 s timeout each) and 15-minute cooldown after all SSIDs fail. State tracked via `smTryIdx`, `smTryAttempts`, `smInCooldown`, `smCooldownUntilMs`.
- **WiFi scan diagnostic logging** — Before each reconnect round the firmware logs all visible SSIDs with channel and RSSI.
- **India WiFi country code** — `esp_wifi_set_country_code("IN", true)` enables channels 1–13, preventing some APs from being missed.
- **WiFi scan-to-add UI** — "Scan" button in the web UI calls `/wifiscan` REST endpoint, shows a dropdown sorted by RSSI with signal-strength bars, lock icon and channel/RSSI info. Clicking a network pre-fills the SSID field.
- **MQTT NVS migration** — `seedDefaultsIfEmpty()` migrates devices that still have the old hardcoded LAN IP stored in NVS to the new domain name without requiring a full factory reset.
- **NVS epoch persistence** — Current time is written to NVS every 5 minutes so the clock survives a power cut even if the DS3231 backup battery is dead.

### Removed
- **BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) completely removed** — `BLEManager.cpp` and all references removed from `main.cpp`, `MQTTManager.cpp`, `HttpServer.cpp` and the web UI. The `handleSetBleEnabled()` HTTP handler is stubbed to return OK for backward compatibility.

### Changed
- **MQTT default broker** — Changed from `192.168.0.102` to `nperiannan-nas.freemyip.com` in `Config.h`.
- **WiFi add-network toast** — Changed from "Network added – connecting..." to "Network saved" since the connection attempt is no longer immediate.
- **WiFi remove-network** — `handleRemoveNetwork()` now only disconnects if the removed SSID is the currently connected SSID.

### Infrastructure
- Port forwarding configured through double NAT (Syrotech BSNL ONT → TP-Link ER605):
  - TCP 1883 → NAS Mosquitto (MQTT, externally reachable)
  - TCP 1880 → NAS Web App (dashboard, externally reachable)
- External URL: `http://nperiannan-nas.freemyip.com:1880` (web UI), `nperiannan-nas.freemyip.com:1883` (MQTT)
